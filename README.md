# CodeSamples

This is a repository containing many of the interesting projects that I have done over the years. 
Project Euler problems, insofar as I post my solutions here, will not have source code as is standard for Project Euler. Instead, I will only give the pseudocode.

Hackerrank or other problems will not be listed here.

The bulk of the repository will be interesting problems that I have encountered, which I consider the code a good representation of either my work or the details of a specific class.
